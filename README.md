# 📽️🍿 TrackFlix: Personal Movie Tracker Desktop App 🖥️

Many movie enthusiasts find it challenging to keep track of the films they have watched, often leading to frustration and wasted time when deciding what to watch next. Popular streaming platforms like Netflix offer features like "My List," but these are limited in functionality which lacks detailed tracking or filtering options. To bridge this gap, TrackFlix aims to provide users with a detailed and personalized record of movies, offering features like progress tracking, filtering, and editing. This will allow users to manage their movie-watching experience, offering capabilities beyond what typical streaming services provide.
